# Machine-Learning-Regression
This repo contains practice codes for Linear Regression and Multiple Regression (for beginners as well).


### Linear regression in Machine learning  
Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning.  
It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables.  
It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting.  
It makes predictions for continuous/real or numeric variables such as sales, salary, age, product price, etc.

### Multiple regression in Machine learning  
Multiple regression is to learn more about the relationship between several independent variables and a dependent variable.  
It is a statistical technique that can be used to analyze the relationship between a single dependent variable and several independent variables.  
Example: We can predict the CO2 emission of a car based on the size of the engine, but with multiple regression we can throw in more variables, like the weight of the car, to make the prediction more accurate.
